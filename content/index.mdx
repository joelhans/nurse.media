High elevation, 280-something days of intense sun, 110Â°F summers, an average of 12 inches of rain every year. The
Sonoran Desert is a <span className="text-orange font-semibold">remarkably harsh place</span>.

Yet the saguaro cactus thrives here. How? They survive and flourish beneath the <span className="text-green
font-semibold">shade of a nurse tree</span>.

Your tech brand is no different.

You're facing constant competition and disruptive thinking. You're either telling the wrong story to the right audience,
or the right story to the wrong audience. You're trying to talk to _everyone_ but are actually talking to no one. You're
attracting the wrong type of visitor.

<span className="text-orange font-semibold">
  You're not telling the story of your ideal customer getting life-changing value from what you do.

<!-- You need a little bit of nurturing. -->

What does that look like?

Together, we identify what's keeping your business from growing. We dissect how your ideal customer talks about their
problems and the solutions they wished they had. We survey your fierce competitive landscape to identify a unique,
inspirational, and defensible story for your brand. We formulate a growth plan, and then I get to work with
deeply-resonant story techniques that inspire the right people to take action.

It's exactly what your brand has been thirsting for.
