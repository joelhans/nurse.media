        Why you&rsquo;re not writing Writers tend to struggle against three main sources of stress: 1) a disinterest in learning how or continuing to write on a regular basis, 2) a lack of time or energy, and 3) worry.
These stressors aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. You might have based your disinterest in worry, or you can feel so overwhelmed by the process of learning how to write that you feel completely drained of creativity.
