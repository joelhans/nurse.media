I'm more than just a copywriter—I'm here help you grow despite the inhospitable world of marketing, product promotion, and customer acquisition. I'm someone who can:


**FOCUS ON THE FACT YOU'RE A COPYWRITER, NOT A GENERAL MARKETER**

--------------------------

Once upon a time there was ___. 
Every day, ___. 
One day ___. 
Because of that, ___. 
Because of that, ___. 
Until finally ___.


# LACK

Long ago, there was ___, who ___.
Every day, they Always thought they needed ___.
Until they are shown they truly Crave ___.
Knowing now what they lack, ___ can now ___.

This method helps me explore not only what the customer already knows they want, but also the story they haven't yet imagined for themselves. It drives to the real motivation behind their desires: the thing they are missing. Their lack.

## Aveeno

Hello,

Thanks so much for the invitation to chat about how I could contribute to Aveeno's copywriting needs over the next few months. Ever since wrapping up a project related to prescriptions and blockchain with a different Johnson & Johnson team, I've been eager to work with the company again.

After conducting user research through interacting with a client or directly with customers in that market, I put tested storytelling framework, which I've lovingly coined the LACK method, to work. What the customer thinks they desire and what they are truly missing—their lack—are often two completely different things. My framework allows me to write copy that targets what the customer is missing, and positions the product as part of the solution to filling that void. By writing to deeper desires, I create instinctual desirability and emotional resonance.

I'm excited by the opportunity to bring this framework and type of storytelling to the skincare industry, which is incredibly personal and guided by many of our deepest, unspoken, and mostly unexplored lacks. I would begin this project by exploring your customers for what they desire, and the underlying motivation behind them. I would then get to work on brainstorming, iterating, and writing initial drafts. After review, I revise and make updates that help the project speak even better to what customers are lacking, and thus what will motivate them to become fully engaged in the great work Aveeno does.

I look forward to hearing from you! I'm available to chat much of next week if your timeline dictates a quick start.

Best,
Joel


# Do you have copywriting experience?

I'm proud of the copywriting I've done in the past, particularly my business-to-consumer work. I love taking time to understand the customer's desires, correlate those with the product's unique features, and crafting a story that makes the customer believe in the product's ability to help them.

Here are a few examples.

I have been working with cloud hosting company SSD Nodes for some time now, and recently had the opportunity to write copy for a landing page that announced a new product on Black Friday.

https://www.ssdnodes.com/black-friday-10x/

Here's how I applied my LACK framework to this project: Extensive research and conversations with customers showed our primary market was individuals who wanted to host their blogs and apps on a platform that was stable, incredibly fast, and at the lowest cost possible. We also understood our customers responded well to data and numerical comparisons.

I created headline copy in the hero that spoke to these immediate desires. But, in the research and planning process, I understood that customers were truly missing the feeling of being innovative or cutting-edge. Since they're programming- technology-oriented people, their careers depend upon being both innovative and first to market. I created copy that speaks to this underlying lack by giving them an opportunity to join a cutting-edge platform at an incredible, limited-time value—an opportunity for them to showcase how forward-thinking they are.

With this landing page and copy, I helped SSD Nodes more than double revenue over the same Black Friday/Cyber Monday period in 2017. We have since translated the fundamental drivers of this copy onto the company's homepage to engage customers in this new higher-price, higher-value option immediately.

I have also written copy and content for brands like IBM, RedHat, and AutoDesk, and I'd be happy to share some of those projects privately if you would like to see more.
