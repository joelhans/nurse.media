## Why you're not writing

Writers have a tendency to struggle against three main sources of stress: 1) a disinterest in learning how or continuing to write on a regular basis, 2) a lack of time or energy, and 3) *worry*.

These stressors aren't mutually exclusive. You can have a disinterest that's founded in worry, or you can feel so overwhelmed by the process of learning how to write that you feel completely drained of creativity. Maybe you're having a particularly hard time at work, or you're trying to build your own business and can't find time to blog among all the bootstrapping. Maybe, like me, you're often finding yourself a little lost among life's many transitions, like trying to claw creative time back after having a kid.

For those who find themselves unwilling to mark up an empty page, or have found themselves circling around the same piece of writing—whether it be a chapter, a blog post, or an email—this exercise just might prove invigorating.


## An exercise to help you write, write regularly, and write without worrying about production

I have my mentor at the University of Arizona, the remarkable Professor Kate Bernheimer, to thank for this exercise. She "assigned" it to me in a time of creative crisis, just before my kid was born.

To begin, you need a few items, many of which you should be able to find around your home or workspace:

  1. A bound and lined notebook. No loose sheets, as they're more likely to make you a cheater, accidental or not.
  2. Something to write with.
  3. Roughly 30 minutes of your time, every day. How you find these minutes is up to you.

The exercise itself is quite simple:

  1. Write in your notebook by hand.
  2. Write about anything you'd like—a fictional story, a to-do list, a wishlist of presents you'd like for your next birthday, or simply journal about what's going on in your life. There are no limits, requirements, or expectations.
  3. Write until you have filled up three complete pages.
  4. Close the notebook and get on with your day.
  5. Repeat the following day.
  6. And, most importantly, **never re-read what you have written on previous days**.

The entire exercise hinges on this final step. Disregard it and you'll probably find that the exercise is a complete failure. It's why I recommend a bound notebook over loose pages, and why I give you the freedom to write about whatever you'd like. It's best to narrow our temptations.

Every day, when it's time to write your pages, simply open up to the next clean page and start. The exercise is simple, but...
