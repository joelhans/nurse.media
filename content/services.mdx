I've seen too many smart businesses with great products idling because their copy and content isn't impactful. Most of
my clients are looking for a package of nurtured copy or content, but I'm happy to discuss custom packages with any
[additional services](#additional-services) I offer.

**Time to put your content strategy into action. More leads for your website to convert. More love for your brand. More
being at the tip of your industry's tongue.**

If you want nurtured content, you want it consistently, and you don't want to think about it for a second, this is the
growth engine you need.

I'll build your content marketing engine, including:

- Regular strategy sessions to get us on the same page
- Weekly long-form posts that are both educational and SEO-optimized
- Newsletter copy to accompany every new post
- Monthly lead magnets to capture leads
- Social media posts for every piece of content to boost engagement

**When you need a professional writer to review your marketing website and make impactful suggestions on driving the
right outcomes.**

If you don't have a large budget, or feel like you have a solid foundation but aren't quite getting the conversion rates
or quality leads you need, I can review your website's copy on a high level and provide suggestions for improvement.

An audit is a fast, cost-effective way to make sure your website is ready to make an impact. You'll get professional
advice based on proven strategies in less than a week.

Here's what you get:

- Two 30-minute phone calls, before and after the engagement, to align on your goals, identify problem areas, and
  discuss user feedback.
- Recorded video screencast so your team can follow along with my impressions and suggestions for improvement.
- Comprehensive booklet of before/after suggestions to help your team make the right changes in the right places.
