            <p class="text-xl mb-6">High elevation, 280-something days of intense sun every year, 110Â°F summers, an average of 12 inches of rain every year: The Sonoran Desert is a remarkably harsh place. And yet, the saguaro cactus thrives here.</p>

            <p class="text-xl mb-6">Confusing content burns a hole in your pocket and prevents your business from growing, much like a young saguaro without its nurse tree.</p>
