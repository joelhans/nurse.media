<Package type="Website copywriting" price="$5,000 - $10,000">

**When you've identified your marketing website as the most impactful way to sell to your target audience, but you're
not sure how to talk about the pains you solve or the benefits you create.**

I know there's many tempting options for website copywriting. You can ask the best writer in the office to stay late on
a Friday afternoon to give it their best, or find a freelancer who gives you a clever tagline and calls it a day, or
even give it a go yourself.

Each of those approaches _might_ work, but we're talking about the <span class="text-green font-semibold">curb appeal of
your entire business here</span>. There's no room for tech businesses who waste time idling around with an ineffective marketing website that doesn't tell a compelling story of how you'll solve your customers' problems.

Whether you're creating a new marketing website, trying to promote an industry-shaking new product, or giving your
existing experience a refresh, I'll work with you on identifying exactly who those customers are, what makes them tick,
and provide you with nurtured copywriting that will start making an impact on day one.

Here's what you get:

- PDF booklet with analysis on your target audience, customer pain points, and key messaging (taglines and CTAs)
- Copywriting for every page on your marketing website, including the homepage, product pages, about page, and more
- Full coordination with your marketing and/or development team to properly implement your new messaging

<Package type="Website audit" price="$599 (paid upfront)">

**When you need a professional writer to review your marketing website and make impactful suggestions on driving the
right outcomes.**

If you don't have a large budget, or feel like you have a solid foundation but aren't quite getting the conversion rates
or quality leads you need, I can review your website's copy on a high level and provide suggestions for improvement. An
audit is a fast, cost-effective to get professional advice based on proven strategies in less than a week.
