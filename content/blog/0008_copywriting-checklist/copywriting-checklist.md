Your copywriting needs to do an incredible amount of work. It needs to engage visitors and inspire them to do something that helps you and (hopefully) offers them some value. And it needs to do that in a matter of seconds.

Whether you've been writing for decades or an indie hacker who's trying bootstrap a landing page as soon as possible, the process of writing impactful copy doesn't really get much easier. There are no shortcuts.

You need a reliable, repeatable process for making your copy foolproof. Enter the *copywriting checklist*.

But this checklist is going to do things a little differently. All the other copywriting checklists ask vague questions you probably don't even understand in the first place.

> Sorry, *Copyblogger*, but what does "Is one dominant emotion (i.e., “mass desire”) powerfully verbalized?" mean?

In this checklist I'm dead-set on practical steps you can take to improve your copy. No fluffy questions. Just practical tips that you can apply to any piece of copywriting even without a lot of experience. We're going to start with some of the bigger-order items and then progress toward the more nuanced word choice and grammatical improvements.

## Ask the copy "why" 5 times

The Japanese carmaker Toyota [changed the way manufacturing companies work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). Part of that revolution comes straight out of a curious toddler's playbook: asking "why" until it's equal parts annoying and incredibly insightful.

Here's an example. Let's say you have a SaaS business called *Proofish* that helps other businesses use [social proof](https://neilpatel.com/blog/social-proof/) on their websites. You just spent time copywriting your new homepage and came up with the following tagline:

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* creates social proof for your website.</span>

Ask that copy "why." Rewrite the tagline to answer it.

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* creates social proof for your website so more visitors turn into customers.</span>

Try again.

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* creates social proof for your website and increases trust so more visitors turn into customers and your revenue grows.</span>

Why?

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* creates social proof for your website and increases trust with automated tools so more visitors turn into customers and your revenue grows—without any extra work on your part.</span>

Go deeper.

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* is social proof automation to boost traffic, trust, and conversions without any extra work on your part.</span>

One more.

<span class="text-green font-bold">*Proofish* automates social proof to effortlessly boost trust, traffic, and conversions.</span>

Now we're talking.

There are two important items to note in this process.

  1. **It gets messier before it gets cleaner.** You'll notice that the first few iterations tend to get longer and less concise because you're adding in features to answer the "why" question. Just remember that by the third or fourth iteration you should be turning toward *the value this product creates* rather than continuing to talk about features.
  2. **You need to know the end before you get there.** The final version should talk directly to how the product/service solves a difficult problem and creates value. In the above example, we're assuming that you've done your customer research and have discovered that trust, traffic, and conversions are the most important metrics for your target customer. If your final "why" misaligns with their needs, you won't have accomplished anything here.


## Look for an overabundance of "we"

A lot of copy in the tech/SaaS space focuses too heavily on the product that's been created or its specific features. It turns attention to the company—or even individuals within the company—instead of focusing on the customer.

I call this we-centric copy.

Take a look at this theoretical example of homepage text from a web hosting company:

<span class="text-green font-bold">Host your website with Hostio.io because we built the fastest, most resilient cloud possible. We used top-of-the-line hardware and <span>


## Avoid generalist language

In fact, make sure your copy has as narrow a target audience as possible. But to start, make sure



- Look for an overabundance of "we"
    - That's a good signal that the copy is focused too heavily on the company's amazing features and not enough on the value the product offers to customers

- Avoid talking about or selling to “everyone”
    - You probably don't have the clout to do that, sorry

- Remove unnecessary jargon but speak to what the audience cares about

- Run your work through an online grammar checker
    - Grammarly is my favorite

- Check for lack of conciseness
    - Remove phrases like "really" or "actually,"
    - "period of time" can be "period"
