Your copywriting needs to do an incredible amount of work. It needs to engage visitors and inspire them to do something that helps you and (hopefully) offers them some value. And it needs to do that in a matter of seconds.

Whether you've been writing for decades or an indie hacker who's trying bootstrap a landing page as soon as possible, the process of writing impactful copy doesn't really get much easier. There are no shortcuts.

You need a reliable, repeatable process for making your copy foolproof. Enter the *copywriting checklist*.

But this checklist is going to do things a little differently. All the other copywriting checklists ask vague questions you probably don't even understand in the first place. 

> Sorry, *Copyblogger*, but what does "Is one dominant emotion (i.e., “mass desire”) powerfully verbalized?" mean?

In this checklist I'm dead-set on practical steps you can take to improve your copy. No fluffy questions. Just practical tips that you can apply to any piece of copywriting even without a lot of experience. We're going to start with some of the bigger-order items and then progress toward the more nuanced word choice and grammatical improvements.

## Ask the copy "why" 5 times.

The Japanese carmaker Toyota changed the way manufacturing companies work. Part of that revolution comes straight out of a curious toddler's playbook.

CHILD: "Why is the sky blue?"
PARENT: "When light passes through our atmosphere, some of it passes through and some of it hits gas molecules and scatters in every direction. The blue light gets the most scattered, and that's why we see so much blue."
CHILD: "Why?"
PARENT: "Well, different colors of light react differently to coming in contact with these gas molecules."
CHILD: "Why?"
PARENT: "Colors of light are traveling at different wavelengths and frequencies."
CHILD: "Why?"
PARENT: "Because light is a wave of energy."
CHILD: "Why?"
PARENT: "I have no idea."




- Ask the copy "so what?" a few times.

    - "Let’s look at the services of a vet. A vet takes care of animals when they need help. So what? So they will grow up much healthier and stronger So what? So they will live longer So what? So a family pet will be part of their family for a long time."


It doesn't matter if you've been in the business for decades or are an indie hacker who just needs to

Too many copywriting checklists focus on trying to answer vague questions that you probably don't even understand in the first place. Sorry, *Copyblogger*, but what does "Is one dominant emotion (i.e., “mass desire”) powerfully verbalized?" mean?

None of that here. In this checklist, we're dead-set on practical steps that anyone, including founders or indie hackers who have no experience in copywriting, can take to improve the quality and impactfulness of their copy. We'll start with the most complex items and progress toward the simpler grammatical-type fixes.



- Look for an overabundance of "we"
    - That's a good signal that the copy is focused too heavily on the company's amazing features and not enough on the value the product offers to customers

- Avoid talking about or selling to “everyone”
    - You probably don't have the clout to do that, sorry

- Remove unnecessary jargon but speak to what the audience cares about

- Run your work through an online grammar checker
    - Grammarly is my favorite

- Check for lack of conciseness
    - Remove phrases like "really" or "actually,"
    - "period of time" can be "period"
