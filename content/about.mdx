**I've been writing professionally for twelve years.**

**I have a Masters (MFA) in creative writing from the University of Arizona.** You'd better believe I'm using all the
skills I learned there to write more impactful copy that's backed by the way real people react to storytelling.

**I've published dozens of short stories at some prestigious magazines.** Read a personal favorite, ["A Man, His
Oblations"](http://notokensjournal.com/fiction/a-man-his-oblations/) of mine.

**I've loved writing for as long as I can remember.**

When I was a freshman at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I wanted to register for an introductory creative
writing course, only to discover it was typically reserved for sophomores or juniors.

I was persistent. I didn't want to wait. The administrators asked me to prove I was good enough by submitting a writing
sample.

<Callout>I got in. I had proof there was value in my passion for writing.</Callout>

After graduating, I landed a job as an editor for a trade publication for industrial maintenance professionals. Sounds
thrilling, right?

I wrote hundreds of stories, published thousands of newsletters, and toured dozens of manufacturing plants. I spoke to
CEOs, grease-to-the-elbows maintenance gurus, and everyone in-between.

I learned about the publishing world, but perhaps more importantly, I learned about how real businesses reached out to
potential customers and talked about their products.

<Callout>
  There, I realized the impact copywriting and content have on a business that wants to grow and
  sell more.
</Callout>

After five years as an editor, my wife was (finally!) graduating from veterinary school. I decided it was time to pursue
a long-held dream of mine: an MFA in creative writing.

After a dozen applications and plenty of nail-biting, the creative writing faculty at the University of Arizona accepted
me into their program. My wife and I moved to Tucson and immediately fell in love with the Sonoran Desert.

After graduating in 2016, I was faced with a choice: Go work in an office for someone else and use my writing talents
every once in a while, or go work for businesses all around the world who need <em>more impactful copy right now</em>.

The decision was easy.

<Callout>In 2016, I launched Nurse to focus on storytelling-driven conversion copywriting.</Callout>

After just a year, I landed clients at some of the highest-profile companies in the tech world. I also had my first
child. Not a bad year, I'd say.

I've expanded my marketing know-how to include SEO, customer research, lead magnets, wireframing for conversion, paid
advertisements, email automation, and even some front-end web development.

But the core of my work is focused directly on growth through nurtured copywriting and proven content strategies.

Or, to put it another way: <span class="text-orange font-bold">I help clients make a lot more money</span>.

The feeling of being accepted into that creative writing class was good. Offering real value to businesses that want to
grow? That's even better.

Let's get results together. [See my work](/work/) and then [get in touch](/contact/).

## Why Nurse?

<Subhead>
  {' '}
  It's a name inspired by my favorite phenomenon of the brutally harsh and beautiful Sonoran Desert.{' '}
</Subhead>

High elevation, 280-something days of intense sun every year, 110Â°F summers, an average of 12 inches of rain every year.
The Sonoran Desert is a remarkably harsh place.

Yet, the saguaro cactus thrives here. It's an iconic emoji, too! ðŸŒµ

How do saguaros survive? Sadly, most don't. Only the seeds lucky enough to be deposited beneath the shade of a mature
mesquite, ironwood, or palo verde trees have a chance.

They prosper under the protection of their nurse tree.

Over the course of decades (saguaros are slow-growers), the cactus outgrows its nurse tree strengthens its south-facing
skin enough to handle the brutal desert sun.

My mission is to help businesses from languishing in the sun with impactful copy and a irresistible story.
