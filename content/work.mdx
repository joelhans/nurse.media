I helped the founder of this Detroit, Mich.-based SaaS startup **identify the real value of his product**, then crafted copywriting that resonates with the pains of the target audience&mdash;PR professionals who want to create impeccable
experiences for the journalists they're pitching&mdash;to inspire sign-ups from high-value prospects.

I worked with the IBM Streams external relations, product, and engineering teams to identify key value propositions and **produce technical content for CTOs and data science professionals**. We even got their biggest customer, Verizon, to cough up details on how they use streaming analytics to make call centers more enjoyable.

As the first marketing hire for SSD Nodes, I played an integral role in their copywriting and content strategy between
2017 and 2019. Major wins include growing the SSD Nodes blog by 3194.12% in just eight months and doubling
year-over-year sales on Black Friday with an impactful landing page that translated technical jargon into _I need that
upgrade right now_ value to existing customers.

I collaborated with the Opentext team on the go-to-market (GTM) strategy for their latest product, Magellan, a flexible
artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics platform. I then created **rich technical assets designed to attract CTOs and
IT team leadership** and begin enterprise sales motions.
